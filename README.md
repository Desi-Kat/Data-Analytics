**Task List:**

- Import libraries and load data
- Clean and preprocess data
- Conduct exploratory data analysis
- Draw conclusions and insights

  Actions:
- Using formulas and measures to create links between tables
- Creating and updating relationships between tables in Model view
- Creating visuals and customising values and visual effects
- Adding Markers and Labels
- Colour coding to emphasise performance

**Conclusions:**

By defining the maximum average discount rate and the minimum profit ratio, I was able to sort the employees into Low, Medium and High performance. By using measures to assign colour, I was able to visually represent this.
